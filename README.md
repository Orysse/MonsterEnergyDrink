## Introduction

Hello,

My name is Abel Chartier and I wanted to share my opinion on the
different Monsters I've been able to drink in my life. I'm a student
at EPITA and this idea came to me during my internship at CEA
Paris-Saclay at DES/DM2S/SGLS/LCAN.

<details>
<summary><b>Pipeline Punch</b></summary>

> _To be retested_

Why **A** ?: It was good in my memory but will be subjected to a more thorough
evaluation soon.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Monarch</b></summary>

> Good amount of sweetness and a simple and refreshing nectarine taste. A good monster overall.

Pros:

- Sweet but not too much

Cons:

- Doesnt have much impact when you drink it

Why **A** ?: A nice taste but not my favorite. Doesn't really feel like a 
monster to me even tho I can feel the cafeine effect.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Khaotic</b></summary>

> Good amount of sweetness and simple orange taste. A good monster overall.

Pros:

- Sweet but not too much

Cons:

- Not the most interesting taste

Why **A** ?: Ok taste in a simple to drink monster. Nothing crazy but 
definitly one I could drink on a regular basis.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Rio Punch</b></summary>

> _To be retested_

Why **A** ?: It was good in my memory but will be subjected to a more thorough
evaluation soon.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Monster Energy</b></summary>

> Strong, bitter taste that wakes you up well.

**Pros:**

- Bold, punchy flavor

**Cons:**

- Strong bitterness, can be hard to finish

Why **A** ?: The original one ! The taste is really what you would like for an
unflavored energy drink, it feels really boosting.

</details>

### B Tier

<details>
<summary><b>Rehab Peach Tea</b></summary>

> Decent Monster, nothing special. Tastes like iced tea at first then
> sugar-free energy drink aftertaste. Pretty average.

**Pros:**

- Refreshing
- Reminds me of Estathè[^1]

**Cons:**

- Noticeable aspartame taste

Why **B** ?: I really liked it the first time but it doesn't really feel like
an energy drink, plus I really don't like the taste of artificial sweeteners.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Mixxd</b></summary>

> Supposed to be tropical fruit but has an unusual financier-like
> taste. Still quite good.

**Pros:**

- Sweet and smooth
- Easy to drink
- Interesting flavor

**Cons:**

- Too sweet
- Not what you'd expect from a tropical Monster

Why **B** ?: Too sweet and not the best taste ever even tho it's ok and original.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Pacific Punch</b></summary>

> Halfway through between the MangoLoco and the Mixxd (Oasis taste with an
> aftertaste of financier), it is a bit too sweet and lack a strong identity.

**Pros:**

- Resemble two really great monsters

**Cons:**

- Too sweet
- No strong identity

Why **B** ?: It taste the same as the Mixxd with less sugar, but with a less
interesting taste so it evens out.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Ultra White</b></summary>

> Strong, somewhat chemical taste with heavy aspartame aftertaste.

**Pros:**

- Not too sweet

**Cons:**

- Aspartame flavor
- Odd taste

Why **B** ?: It feels too fake, I can't link the taste to anything I know.
Plus aspartame is my ops ngl.

</details>

---

### C Tier

<details>
<summary><b>Rehab Tea + Lemonade</b></summary>

> Like the Rehab Peach Tea but lemon flavored and without the
> nostalgic appeal.

**Pros:**

- Refreshing

**Cons:**

- Strong aspartame taste

Why **C** ?: I'm not a fan of both Rehab monster but this one fells worth than
the other so it is bellow. It has the same weak point as the Peach Tea and lost
the nostalgia point I gave to the later.

</details>

---

### E Tier

<details>
<summary><b>Ultra Golden Pineapple</b></summary>

> Tastes like bad medicine (pineapple fizzy tablets). Barely any real
> pineapple flavor.

**Pros:**

- It's still a Monster

**Cons:**

- Bad taste

Why **E** ?: I really hated it. Ananas isn't a fruit I would like in a
carbonated beverage to begin with and I now know why. Really not for me.
